# VARTA-Launcher
 The Launcher for the VARTA Project
 
 ## Introduction
 This is the Launcher for the VARTA Project. It is a simple Unity2D project that allows you to start the VARTA Project with a single click. It also allows you to upload your own text (txt) documents to the game for use in the games practice mode.
 This launcher is meant for use by a teacher or a parent who wants to use the VARTA Project in a classroom or at home. It is not meant for use by the students themselves. The launcher is meant to be used in conjunction with the VARTA Project.
 The launcher opens on a computer only, not on a VR device. It is meant to be used on a computer that is connected to a VR device.
 
 ## Installation
 To install this application, you need to either download the pre-built version which includes the game, or download the source code and build it yourself in Unity.
 Build the project in a folder called "VARTA", or whatever you like, with a subfolder alongside the launcher files called "Game". This is where the game will be built by Unity.
 
 ## Usage
 To use the launcher, simply open the executable file. The launcher will open and you will be presented with a menu. The menu has two buttons, one for starting the game, and one for uploading a text file.
 To close the launcher, use the "X" button in the top right corner of the window. To upload a text (txt) document, click the upload button on the left with an image of a file above a harddrive.
 This will open an explorer window in the folder where the text documents can be dropped. Simply drag and drop the text document into the window and it will be uploaded to the game. The text document will be used in the practice mode of the game.
 Any type of file can be uploaded, however only text (txt) files will be read by the game. To start the game, click the button on the right with an image of a VR headset and a book. This will start the game and the launcher will pause in the background.
 Instructions are included on the menu screen of the launcher for how to use it.
